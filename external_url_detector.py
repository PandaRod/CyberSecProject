# This script monitors external data sharing when querying Wikipedia's API.
# It uses Python's `requests` library to send a query to Wikipedia's API and checks if
# any URLs in the response are external (i.e., not belonging to Wikipedia).
# The script scans the response for URLs using a regular expression (via `re` library)
# and flags any external URLs.
# The script requires the `requests` library to be installed. If not installed, use the
# following command:
# pip install requests

# This script draws inspiration from the methods outlined in the paper "Sensitive Information Tracking in Commodity IoT" by Z. Berkay Celik et al.
# The paper focuses on the importance of monitoring and tracking the flow of sensitive information within IoT ecosystems to detect potential data leaks
# or unauthorized external transmissions. Specifically, the methodology in the paper revolves around identifying "data sinks"â€”external entities or networks
# that may unintentionally or maliciously receive sensitive data.
#
# In this script, a similar concept is applied by monitoring Wikipedia's API responses. The goal is to check for any external URLs
# in the API response that could indicate data being shared with third-party domains outside of Wikipedia. By identifying such URLs,
# the script ensures that potentially sensitive information is not leaking to external sites. This is analogous to tracking how IoT devices
# might transmit sensitive data to external networks or services. The method helps detect unintentional or harmful data sharing, maintaining
# data privacy and security during interaction with the Wikipedia API.
